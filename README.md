# Krusties

Krusties is a video game that teaches users how to prepare a burger based on a recipe. It uses a first-person movement system which simulates cooking in real life. This game is inspired by Spongebob, the cartoon on Nickelodeon. The recipe used in our game is the one used to make a Krabby Patty in the Spongebob cartoon.  

At the start of the level, a list of hotkeys will be displayed on the top left corner. When the “R” key is pressed, a recipe will be shown to the user which includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions on how to complete the dish. A timer on the top right corner of the screen will start counting down. The user must complete the dish within the given time to win the level.  

The user can walk around the kitchen to pick up and place ingredients onto a grill to cook them. Once all the individual ingredients are fully prepared. The user can take a plate and place all the delicious food onto it however they like to decorate it based on their creativity.  

Finally, the user will look for Mr Krabs to inform him that the dish is completed and ready for evaluation. Mr Krabs will taste the dish and evaluate it on a rating of 5 stars. Every star that a user collects will be accumulated on their profiles. The users could view their own ranking on the leader board which is sorted based on the total number of stars a user has.
